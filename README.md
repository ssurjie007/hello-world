I have over 14 years using Excel and its macros to automate and increase productivity at my job at BrowardHealth, a medical provider in south Florida, USA
Curently now I am having newer interests in PHP, MySql, MS Office and WordPress. 
I want to develop a personal app that could make my work much easier because my excel files are crashing due to their growing sizes.
I should have used Access from day one, as the problem is a database issue.
On my personal side, I need to develop a tiny app that could quickly log any ideas comes to my mind, into my phone.
I am hoping to write an ebook and will then turn towards these ideas to pave the chapters of my ebook.
I started off my wordpress website www.searchingforanotheryou.com It is incomplete, please ignore the blog on gravity, it is temporary.
I accidentally stumble on GitHub today, so here I am exploring it being a newbie.
